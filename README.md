# Matlab-Simulink-Stateflow
A mini project on Traffic Light control along with pedestrian light using Matlab/simulink/stateflow
This project is aimed at developing a typical traffic light control system along with pedestrian crossing using matlab simulink and stateflow.
Please go through SPS document once before you start.
The simulink model is configured for a cycle of operation by default with simualtion time of 150. 
Two signal builder blocks from simulink Library is used to simulate the activation of two push buttons for pedestrians in the user input block.
